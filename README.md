### Introduction
If it hasn't been obvious enough, this is my website, where I do my coding. 

### Purpose
I mainly decompile Google Doodles (still in progress) and store all my assets here because Github made this place cosy for them. Therefore, they are comfortable with you using them in your projects.

### Copyright
Use the assets however you please. Credit is optional.
