### Introduction
If it hasn't been obvious enough, this is my website, where I do my coding. 

### Purpose
I mainly decompile Google Doodles (still in progress) and store all my assets here.

### Copyright
The assets here told me that they want to be free to find themselves a spot in other websites without huge heavy copyright metadata and tags.

Therefore, you can freely use the assets (with the exception of those in the "google" folder) in your projects or websites however you please. Credit is optional.
