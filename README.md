### Introduction
If it hasn't been obvious enough, this is my website, where I do my coding. 

### Purpose
I mainly decompile Google Doodles (still in progress) and store all my assets here.

### Copyright
The assets here told me that they want to spread to other websites and projects. I was like, "Sure! Be free to find yourselves a new place".

So now you can freely use the assets (with the exception of those in the "google" folder) in your projects or websites however you please. Credit is optional.
